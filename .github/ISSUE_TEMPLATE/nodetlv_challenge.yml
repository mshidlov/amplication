        ## Welcome to Node.TLV Challenge
        ### Share with us your best idea, for anything that can make backend developers' life easier, better, faster - for a chance to win a MacBook Pro
        1. Create a feature request in our project repo on GitHub with your idea. Use the QR code to navigate to the special "node.TLV challenge" 
        2. Come visit us at our booth to approve your submission and pick up the coolest "open-source" t-shirt.
        3. Share the idea with your colleagues and friends. 
        
        The list of ideas will be shared with Amplication's community on Discord and Twitter and displayed in our booth. Anyone can vote for the best idea. 
        
        The best idea with the most upvotes will win a MacBook Pro.
        
        The challenge ends at 15:45, and the winner will get the MacBook Pro at the last coffee break between 15:45 and 16:00.
