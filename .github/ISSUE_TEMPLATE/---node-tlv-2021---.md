Wellcome to Amplication feature suggestion contest 🥳🎉🎊

Amplication is an open-source low-code platform for backend and full-stack developers. Amplication's goal is to help developers and empower their code generation. The application code owner is the developer, and Amplication supports the project by providing a robust base. When developing projects with Amplication, developers can create great applications without the nuisance of being "bogged down" with building and maintaining the application's infrastructure and architecture.

Our product is made by developers for developers and this is your chance to impact Amplication future.
